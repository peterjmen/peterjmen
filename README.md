I'm enthusiastic about starting work as a Software Developer, and I seek a role filled with problem-solving opportunities. My interests lie in Backend Development, Data Engineering, and extend to Data Analysis, Machine Learning, and AI â€“ topics I've explored in my elective studies.

With a background in health sciences and physiotherapy, I offer a unique interdisciplinary perspective and understanding. My hands-on experience spans software development, web development, data science, machine learning, and AI. Collaborating as part of teams on various practical projects has contributed to solidifying skills in these areas.

Outside of work, I am intellectually curious and seek opportunities to gain skills whether it's Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, rock climbing, or board games, I enjoy improving my abilities and acquiring new knowledge.

I am open to a variety of roles and may excel in areas such as health informatics, digital health, or sports science technology due to my domain knowledge in physiotherapy, sports medicine, and sports exercise science.
